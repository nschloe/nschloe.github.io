# Math on GitHub: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

On May 19, 2022, GitHub released one of its most requested features: [Math
support on Markdown](https://github.blog/2022-05-19-math-support-in-markdown/)!
I myself had been waiting for this to happen for many years, 


## Prior art

GitLab https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#math

````markdown

```math
E = mc^2E = mc^2
```

And inline math $`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`$

````


## The Good

## The Bad

- math in lists
- MathJax vs KaTeX

## The Ugly

- Font size

Try it here:
$$
x^2
$$
