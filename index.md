Hi! This is Nico, big nerd with a math background. I'll write irregularly on
topics that interest me, mostly math and programming (duh).

[Here's my GitHub page](http://github.com/nschloe) in case you're in for a deep
dive. You'll also find [the sources of this
blog](https://github.com/nschloe/nschloe.github.io).
